the words i never got to hear
i am a better person 
still here - but different
some part of you is mine
it moves through me now
i let it go
i do not run from it
here is peace 
the world begins again
i walk with memory
the silence is not empty
it blooms within me
love has no end
you are all around
i feel it in the wind
i carry light
