i feel it

become a better girl
become a better person
here to-morrow

here's my hand
a cloud that shrouds the sun
still your friend
still your daughter
still as though i had been shot
here with me
alive at the same time
still sitting quietly in my own place
here just a year ago
here, i am home
here - to this place
we two may meet again
home at last
that night saw old wrongs forgiven
the things i never said
outloud
in silence
the things you never got to speak
